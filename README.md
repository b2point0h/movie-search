Movie Search Application
================================

## Requirements

- [X] Go to omdbapi.com to start using the API documentation

- [X] Use OMDb's 'By Search' parameters to return movie data based on the value of the search field. The data should return in JSON format.

- [X] Display search results on the page. The data should load inside the #movies ul

- [X] Display a placeholder icon when the API does not return poster data

- [X] If the search returns no movie data, display the text "No movies found that match: 'title'."

- [X] Make sure you add code comments to document how your code works

- [X] Use JSHint (see the link in the Project Resources section) to analyze your JavaScript and identify any errors or code-style problems

- [X] Make sure your program is free of syntax errors.


## Extra Credit

- [X] Filter the search by year of release

- [X] Link a movie to its IMDb page. Wrap the poster image -- or everything in the li -- in an anchor tag that links a movie to its imdb.com page

- [X] Create a movie description page. Load or link to a description page displaying a movie's title, year, poster, plot information, and IMDb rating
